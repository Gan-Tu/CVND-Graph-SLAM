# Landmark Detection & Robot Tracking (SLAM)

## Project Objective

In this project, I'll implement SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world, where it tracks the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features.

## Result

This project is finished and you can view the results in notebook 3.

I will update this section soon.
